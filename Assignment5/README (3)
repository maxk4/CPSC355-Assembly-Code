I am making a program that displays a table N x N with randomized digits(positive integers between 0 and 9) which is a 2d array. The program takes in user input, and what number the user wants to search for in the randomized table. The program searches for that digit the user input, giving the numbers statistics in the table of where exactly it was found, the coordinates. I am also utilizing subroutines for my program,and splitting up my code into functions as appropriate. Once the user is done running the program, the most recent ouput is written out in a log file called assign5.log I run the program using the command ./assign5. I compile my program by running the command m4 assign5.asm > assign5.s for macros first and then gcc assign5.s -o assign5. To see my log file you write the command cat assign5.log, this log file shows the table, digit, and statistics of the digit found.
