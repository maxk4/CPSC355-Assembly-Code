I am making a program that displays a table n x n with randomized digits which is a 2d array, and the size of the table is given as a command line argument. The program takes in user input and what number the user wants to search for in the randomized table and then looping through the array and looking for this number that was saved. It then prints out how many times this number was found, the percentage of how many times the number appears in the table, and the coordinates it was found at. My program uses the search algorithm of going through the array using a double for loop to iterate it to each row and column of those random numbers to find the one that was selected by the user. I run the program using the command ./assign1 5, the digit 5 can be anything the user chooses it to be(I just used 5 as an example)that is just the table size, the larger the number the larger the table. I compile my program by running the command gcc assign1.c -o assign1. To run my log file you do the command: cat assign1.log, this log file shows exactly which digits the user chose and the statistics before exiting the program.
